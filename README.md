In platform engineering are a few areas you should focus on:

## Resource management

This includes more than just billing and budgets; it also involves your organizational structure. Project liens are an important resource management tool. A project lien blocks projects from being deleted without approval.

## Access management

Choose components that allow you to create and manage identity groups, use IAM service accounts, and securely work with external identity providers.

## Networking

Your developers should be able to benefit from your network without having to interact with it directly or frequently. 



## ChatGPT for platform engineering

ChatGPT and other AI tools will be a game changer for debugging and troubleshooting infrastructure.

Take k8sgpt, for example. 
It advertises itself as a tool that diagnoses and triages your K8s clusters in simple English. 

AI can fix problems in real time, reducing the need for engineers to be on-call.

AI is not human, and it won’t be anywhere near sentient for a long time. 

In the meantime, we can leverage machines to lift repetitive work and toil off our shoulders. 
ChatGPT isn’t creative, it just formulated solutions based on existing information it can find. 

Examples:

+ Templates based on your requirements. (No more looking for YAML online)
+ Templates based on another service.
+ Recommendations to upsize or downsize infrastructure based on traffic.
+ Cost recommendations for your cloud providers based on your usage.
